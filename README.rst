countlinepy(Count Line of file py)
==================================
The main objective is to count the lines of a python file and exclude comments
and docstring. This is a very basic project to learn to work with the
bookstore `os`.

The result is printed as a table in the console.

Note: For what functions we must configure the directory that we are going to
read from the file `countloc.py`. The addresses are stored in the rootDir and
path variables.
